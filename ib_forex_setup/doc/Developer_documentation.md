## 1. Introduction

The `ib_forex_setup` is a Python-based trading application designed for forex trading with Interactive Brokers. Once you make changes to source code files, this little guide focuses on enabling you to:
1. Build the setup wheel once you tweak anything of the source code.
2. Force the reinstallation of the setup package in the Python environment.
3. Run once again your setup with the new changes made.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Modifying and Running

Follow these steps to modify the code, rebuild, reinstall, and run the application:

<a id='navigate'><a>
### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Root
Navigate to the root directory of the `ib_forex_setup` project. This is the directory that contains the `src/` folder. Check any of the Python files located in the `src/` folder and see which files and their functions you want to modify or tweak.

<a id='modify'><a>
### Step 2: Make Your Code Modifications

1.  **Identify the files to modify**:
    * For **strategy logic** (signals, stop-loss, take-profit, feature engineering): Edit `ib_forex_setup/samples/strategy.py`.
    * For **core application logic** (how the engine runs, data handling, IB interactions): Edit files within `ib_forex_setup/src/ib_forex_setup/`.
    * For **run parameters** (account, symbol, timezone, etc.): You can modify `ib_forex_setup/samples/main.py`.

2.  **Edit the Python files**: Use your preferred text editor or IDE to make the desired changes to the `.py` files. For example, you might change the logic in `get_signal` within `samples/strategy.py` or adjust parameters in `samples/main.py`.

<a id='build'><a>
### Step 3: Build the Package

Once you have made your changes, you need to rebuild the Python package.

1. **Open a terminal and type the following:**
```bash
cd path_to/ib_forex_setup
```
*(Replace `path_to/ib_forex_setup` with the actual path to your project.)*

2.  **Install the `build` tool (if you haven't already)**:
    ```bash
    pip install build
    ```

3.  **Build the package**:
    From the root directory of the `ib_forex_setup` project, run:
    ```bash
    python -m build
    ```
    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py`) and creates the package. You will see output in your terminal indicating the build process. Upon completion, a `dist/` directory will be created (or updated) in your project root, containing files like `ib_forex_setup-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` (the version number might differ).

<a id='reinstall'><a>
### Step 4: Reinstall the Modified Package

To ensure your Python environment uses your newly modified code, you must reinstall the package from the wheel file you just built. The `--force-reinstall` flag is important to ensure the existing version is overwritten.

```bash
pip install dist/ib_forex_setup-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```
*(Adjust the filename `ib_forex_setup-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` if your built package has a different version or name. Check the contents of your `dist/` folder.)*

This step updates the installed `ib_forex_setup` library in your Python environment with the changes you made in the `src/` directory.

<a id='run'><a>
### Step 5: Run the Trading Setup

After successfully reinstalling the package, you can run the main application script.

1.  **Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`**:
    Based on the project folder, this is located in the `main` directory. 

    ```bash
    cd main 
    ```

2.  **Execute the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The application should now run with your modifications. Check the console output and any generated log files (e.g., in `data/log/`) to verify your changes are active and behaving as expected. The `main.py` script in the `main` folder is set up to import and use the `ib_forex_setup` package you just rebuilt and reinstalled.

## 3. Important Considerations

* **Virtual Environments**: It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (like Conda environments, as suggested in the `README.md`) for this project. This isolates dependencies and ensures a clean workspace. Make sure you are in your activated environment when running these commands.
* **Dependencies**: If you add new library dependencies in your code modifications (e.g., by importing a new package in `strategy.py`), you might need to update the project's dependencies, typically listed in `pyproject.toml` or a `requirements.txt` file, and reinstall them in your environment. However, for simple logic changes within existing files, this is often not necessary.
* **Testing**: Thoroughly test your changes in a paper trading account before deploying them in a live trading environment.
* **Backup `data/` folder**: The `data/` folder (especially `database.xlsx` and model files in `data/models/`) stores important trading information and trained models. Back it up regularly, especially before making significant changes or running new optimization processes.
* **Strategy Optimization**: The `strategy.py` file includes a function `strategy_parameter_optimization()`. If you modify features or core logic used by this optimization, you may need to re-run it to ensure your models are tuned to your new setup. This function saves models like `hmm_model_YYYY_MM_DD.pickle` and `model_object_YYYY_MM_DD.pickle` in the `data/models/` directory.

By following these steps, you can effectively customize the `ib_forex_setup` to your trading needs. Remember to always proceed with caution, especially when dealing with financial applications.
