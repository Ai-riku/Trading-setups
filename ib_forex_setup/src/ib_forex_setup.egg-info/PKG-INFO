## Setup details
- The trading setup allows you to trade any forex asset available in Interactive Brokers.
- You can only trade forex assets with this trading setup.
- It uses the stable version of the Interactive Brokers API (IB API).
- It can be used with the TWS platform or the IB Gateway as long as the trader installs the stable versions of each.
- The setup is packaged as a Python library and is installable with one single code line.
- You can use the trading setup package with any operating system, and from any country or timezone.
- There are two files apart from the trading setup package: The 'main' file and the 'strategy_file' file. You can use the former to run the whole trading setup. You can change the latter at your discretion. The latter contains all the relevant functions you can tweak to use your strategy.
- The package has 7 modules, see:
    - create_database.py (to create the trading Excel file to save all the setup output)
    - engine.py (the main loop functions to run the setup for each period)
    - ib_functions.py (IB-based customized functions to be used for the below modules)
    - setup.py (the setup class)
    - setup_for_download_data.py (the setup class and functions to download the historical minute data)
    - setup_functions.py (the customized functions to be used by the setup class)
    - trading_functions.py (the functions to be used by the above modules)
- The setup is ready to be tested or modified to meet your needs.

<a id='start'></a>
## Quick start
1. Download the "dist" and the "samples" folders, and save them in the “..path_to/Jts/setup" folder.
2. Open an Anaconda terminal (or a terminal in Linux or Mac), then type (wait until each command is completely run):

    - conda create --name setup_env python=3.12
   
      ![image01](res/image01.png)
      
    - conda activate setup_env
      
      ![image02](res/image02.png)
      
    - conda install spyder
      ![image03](res/image03.png)
      
    - cd 'path_to/Jts'
      ![image04](res/image04.png)
    - pip install ib_forex_setup/dist/qi_forex_setup-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
      ![image05](res/image05.png)

4. Since you have already installed the IB API in 'path_to/Jts/tws_api'. Let's install it in our 'setup_env" environment. Type:
    - cd 'path_to/Jts/tws_api/source/pythonclient'
      ![image06](res/image06.png)
    - python setup.py install
      ![image07](res/image07.png)
    - cd C:\Jts
      ![image08](res/image08.png)
    - spyder
      ![image09](res/image09.png)
5. Once Spyder is opened, select as main folder the "setup" folder and open the "main.py" 
6. Modify the inputs as per your trading requirements.
7. Run the file, and ...

# Go live algo trading!
