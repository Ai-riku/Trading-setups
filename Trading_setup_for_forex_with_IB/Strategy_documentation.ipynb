    "## Introduction\n",
    "We are happy to introduce our working setup to trade forex algorithmically with the Interactive Brokers API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to our labor of love as a Python-based setup, trading app, or similar names. We hope it’s self-evident that they all refer to the same thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "This script allows you to execute transactions in the forex market using a customizable strategy and swap out forex assets as needed. The script-based application aims to teach you the basics of using a ready-made IB-API-based trading app and how it works during each trading period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation explains the basics of implementing a strategy in the trading app. You will learn the steps followed in the strategy and the variables used. You can make major changes following the functions’ outputs. However, if you want to make changes beyond the functions’ outputs, we suggest you revise the entire script’s code to modify it according to your trading needs."

    "    - Subset the dataframe based on the most recent \"train_span\" observations.\n",

    "    - Create the \"windows\" list that will contain all the available window sizes to be used for the creation of technical indicators.\n",
    "    - Create the percentage returns of the OHLC data and their respective lags.\n",
    "    - Use a for loop that will iterate through the \"windows\" list. It will create a group of technical indicators based on each window. The loop will:\n",

    "    - Check for stationarity for all the technical indicators. If the TI is stationary, we use it as an input feature. If it's not, we use its percentage returns as an input feature.\n",
    "    - Create more features using signals based on moving averages and standard deviations of the Close prices.\n",
    "4. **Concatenating the necessary dataframes into a single dataframe**\n",
    "    - Create a list of features that can be transformed into a rolling zscore. Name them as \"scalable_features\"\n",
    "    - Create the \"base_df\" datagrame that will be used in another function to create the X and y features.\n",

For example, in case you want to make the test span to be 1 month, please change the code line 391 as ```test_span = 22*periods_per_day```since a month has 22 days approximately. Otherwise, you can set this variable as per your specific number of observations by defining it in the main file (The variable to change is ```test_span_days```).\n",

    "    - To create the X and y dataframes, it uses the ```create_Xy``` function explained previously in the ```get_signal``` function above.\n",
    "    - Split the X and y dataframes into train and test dataframes. It uses a function called ```train_test_split``` explained previously in the ```get_signal``` function above. This time the test_span variable is not 1. It's actually the test_span defined in Section 1.\n",

    "    - Create the Directional-Change R indicator.\n",
    "    - Define an HMM model object and fit the model.\n",

    "    - Apply the Boruta-Shap algorithm and save the best features in the ```selected_features``` list.\n",
    "5. **Estimate the models based on the list of seeds**\n",
    "    - Create 2 dictionaries to save the ML-based model objects and their corresponding Sharpe ratio values.\n",
    "    - Set an ```annualize_factor``` to compute the Sharpe ratio.\n",
